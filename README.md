# 🚀 Open Data Pipeline for Real-Time Insights

This is a real-world, end-to-end **Data Engineering project** designed to simulate building a modern data platform using only free and open-source tools.

We’ll cover the full lifecycle: **ingestion ➝ storage ➝ processing ➝ orchestration ➝ visualization**.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

| Step                   | Tool                            | Why It's Used                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Data Ingestion         | Python + Public APIs             | Flexible and easy to automate        |
| Messaging (optional)   | Apache Kafka                     | Real-time data streaming             |
| Storage                | PostgreSQL + Parquet             | Relational + Lakehouse-style hybrid  |
| Processing             | Apache Spark (PySpark)           | Big data transformation              |
| Orchestration          | Apache Airflow (Dockerized)      | Workflow scheduling and monitoring   |
| Visualization          | Apache Superset or Metabase      | Business Intelligence dashboards     |
| Deployment             | Docker                           | Environment isolation & portability  |

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Create reusable ETL pipelines (batch + real-time)
- Learn the difference between **ETL vs ELT**, **Batch vs Streaming**
- Use tools like **Airflow, Spark, Kafka** in realistic ways
- Build dashboards from live data
- Deploy and document your project like a pro

---

## 📡 Data Sources (API-based)

We’ll be using public APIs such as:

- [Open-Meteo (weather)](https://open-meteo.com/)
- [CoinGecko (crypto)](https://www.coingecko.com/)
- [NYC Taxi Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
- [Yahoo Finance (via yfinance)](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)

## 🛠️ Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Setup & Batch Ingestion
- Set up Python environment
- Choose public API
- Ingest data → Save as CSV/Parquet
- Load into PostgreSQL
- Explore data with Pandas & SQL

### 🔄 Phase 2: Data Lakehouse
- Store raw data as Parquet
- Use Delta Lake (delta-rs or delta.io)
- Clean data with PySpark

### 🌀 Phase 3: Orchestration
- Use Docker + Apache Airflow
- Create DAGs for daily ingestion + cleaning

### 📡 Phase 4: Real-Time Streaming
- Use Apache Kafka to stream data
- Consume and store in PostgreSQL + Parquet
- Handle late data, upserts

### 📊 Phase 5: Analytics & Dashboards
- Connect Superset or Metabase to PostgreSQL
- Build & share dashboards
